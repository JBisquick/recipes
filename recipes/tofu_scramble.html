        <h3>Yummy and Easy Vegan Air Fried Tofu Potato Scramble</h3>
        <p>I love a scrambie on a lazy Sunday morning, but standing over the stove doesn't feel lazy! For the last few weeks, I've been working out how to make my family's favorite tofu and potato scramble (with broccoli!) in my air fryer for ultimate laziness, and last weekend. The result is crispy potatoes, tender tofu, and perfect broccoli ready in just over 30 minutes, but with no standing over the stove! Tofu and potato scramble is my new favorite weekend breakfast!</p>
